Currently we have no support for automatic NAT/router traversal for either the UDP or TCP traffic. Also, we have no way of identifying our 
public external IP address (as this is necessary for the User Distributed Map).

Potential technologies to use/look into in the future include:

STUN (for UDP packet traversal)
NAT-PNP and UPNP (for automatic port forwarding via routers that support it)
  - Azureas has some good libraries
  
The concept of the User Distributed Map could potentially be integrated directly with Kademlia -
 eliminating the need to have prior knowledge of our IP address (but how would we sign our identity to our location?)
